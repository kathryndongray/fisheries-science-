## 23/11/21

Kathryn expresses her preference for a project that limits the use of R. 
She has started to digest the maths in chapter 4 of the book by Andersen.
I suggest that after that she will want to go back to chapter 2 and
understand the role of the prey preference function in the model. 
To make her project as analytical as possible, she might then look into
the trait-based model, for which some analytical results are described
in chapter 11. 

We briefly discuss the preliminary report. I tell her that she can choose
any topic related to her project to write about. She should choose
something that she has already read a bit about and understood well, so
that she can explain it well and provide links to the literature. The
preliminary report will not be judged on the amount of content but on
the clarity of the presentation.

Kathryn impresses me greatly by having digested almost all of Ken's book already
(up to chapter 10), with detailed notes. She has spotted a mistake in the book
and during our discussion we identify a second. I encourage her to get in touch
with Ken about these mistakes.

Most of Ken's book does not care about species identity, which is something we
will be interested in when studying the diet. Kathryn will go on to the
trait-based model discussed in chapter 11. We'll meet again in week 2 of spring
term.
